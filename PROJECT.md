Mid-Project Guidelines
===

## Planning

* Application Workflows
    * Define the actions the API allows
    > These are your "user stories"

    * What are the connection points?
    > Remember: you are not building the 
    "connection" between workflows that an app
    would normally handle. Plan your demo accordingly to simulate

* Data Model
    * Whiteboard good
    * Design models and relationships
    * perfect is the enemy of the good

* Contributor Guidelines
    * Single coding style and adhere to it
    * Write this out in your README.md as you decide

## Sprint 0

Requirement by Monday morning!
* Planning items complete
* Everyone can push new code to heroku

## Working as a Group
* Pairing/mobbing provides better quality consistency, but is slower over the short-term
* You have a week, product won't be maintained
* Be judicious about splitting up to parallelize
* Physical distance has impact on communication
* Try and work vertically:
    * Individual experience
    * horizontal === not done
    * vertical === done


## Structuring Work

* Prefer doing to talking about (do as you talk)
    * Example: README.md
* Limit WIP (Work in Progress)
> 1 thing 100% done `>` 10 things < 100% done

* Work on "User Stories"
* Have a branching strategy

## Testing

* Testing on a short project has little-to-no value if done test-after
* Decide whether:
    1. project will be green and incrementally expanded
    1. project will be integrated heroically after the fact

If not explicitly choosing and following #1, you are doing #2
