# Jubilant Disco
### A matchmaking service for music lovers
Created by students of Alchemy Code Labs, midterm back end project, 401 Full Stack JavaScript, summer 2017

## Summary

Jubilant Disco matches users together with a compatibility algorithm using their top 10 favorite albums. It accounts for genre, artist, and album matches, as well as where the albums are ranked in their list. It uses an MLab-hosted MongoDB via Mongoose, and NodeJS' Express package, as well as other NPM resources (see package.json for full list of dependencies). Jubilant Disco is currently hosted on Heroku <a href="https://jubilant-disco.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

### Current State

Our algorithm is in place, database aggregation is functional, and the back end has met MVP. We have a rudimentary front-end drafted out and deployed for visual reference, though it is not functional at this time.
